# gravispy
Visualization of exact solutions to Einstein's Field Equations using Python.

### Requirements

+ numpy
+ vispy
+ pyopencl ( prospectively )

The following link is a very helpful pointer toward the sort of tools we might consider using:

Although the topics it mentions are a little advanced, it is noted that [gravipy](https://pypi.org/project/GraviPy/) is a very fast module for doing calculations necessary to be able to calculated the trajectories of time-like geodesics: specifically, note the section 4.3 (Visualizing geodesics).
I still think we are better off for now simply hardcoding such data; and even more so only focusing on the Schwarzschild metric.
